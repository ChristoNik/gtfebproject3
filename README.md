## Project 3 Group List

Please pull this repository, update the list in `teams.txt` with your team information in the format provided, and push it back to this repository on *a separate branch*.  I will merge the file.

The structure is defined at the top of the file -- DO NOT REMOVE THIS!

## Instructions

*You can edit a text file directly on GitHub!*

GitHub will actually fork the repository to your account, and open a Pull Request with your changes, which I will review and merge accordingly.


## Deliverables

- **Deliverable 1** *(Due July 3, 2018)*
  - Create a file called `index.md` in your `docs` folder at the root of your project.
  - Using markup, write to your `index.md` file the following:
    - Overview of the intended application, and why you feel it's valuable.
    - A breakdown of roles by group member.
    - A schedule for completion of various tasks.
    - A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.
    - A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.
  - Add the `docs` folder and file(s) to your repo, and push it to the GitHub repository you will use for your final project.
  - Set up GitHub pages to publish this documentation [like this](https://blog.github.com/2016-08-22-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages/)

More [useful information here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on how to make your markdown awesome (include images, typography, etc).

You may also put these requirements in separate markdown files and link to them, if you so choose.

- **Deliverable 2** *(Due July 10, 2018)*
  - Add another screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule to your `docs` markdown file. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.
  - You should also have a link to your MVP project on Heroku listed somewhere in your repository.  Probably best if you add it to the Description at the top of the repo page on GitHub.

- **Deliverable 3** *(Due July 17, 2018)*
  - Add the following to your docs folder (either in the same `index.md` file, or a separate markdown file):
    - A summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.
    - A detailed description of each person's contributions.
    - A detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
      - Stretch Features
      - Bugs
      - Enhancements
      - UI Polishing

- **Deliverable 4** *(Due July 24, 2018)*
  - Update your `README.md` to describe your project, how to run it, protocol for making changes, deployment links, etc, prior to presentation day.

Good luck!
